# Introduction 
This project explores Netflix's vast content library using SQL queries to uncover key insights about media types, top directors, release trends, and geographic distribution. By analyzing structured data, I aim to highlight patterns in content production and distribution over time.

SQL queries? Check them out here: [sql_projects_folder](/SQL_Projects/)

# Background
Netflix hosts a diverse range of content spanning multiple genres, formats, and regions. Understanding trends in media types, top contributors, and release patterns can provide valuable insights into how content is curated and consumed.

### The questions i wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the types of Netflix Media?
2. What are the Top 10 Directors?
3. What is the proportion Of Directors With Name Given And Name Not Given?
4. What are the Top 10 Directors excluding director Not Given?
5. What are the Top 10 Days? (LIMIT 10 was used for continuity. I know there are only 7 days!üòÇ).
6. What are the Top 10 Months?
7. What are the Top 10 Quarters?
8. What are the Top 10 Release Years?
9. What are the Top 10 Release Years And Quarters?
10. What are the Top 10 Ratings?
11. What are the Top 10 Countries?
12. What are the Top 10 Countries By Movie Count?
13. What are the Top 10 Countries By TV Show Count?


# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the Netflix Media Market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the Netflix Media.
Here's how I approached each question:


### 1. üî¢The Count, üíØPercentage, ‚è≥Previous Count, üìàüìâPercentage Change & üèÖCount Rank Of The Types Of Netflix Media[.sql](1_The_Count_And_Percentage_Of_Types_Of_Netflix_Media.sql)
To identify the Count, Percentage, Previous Count, Percentage Change & Count Rank the following functions were used: `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `LAG` and `DENSE_RANK`.

**III:** August experienced the biggest drop (-8.83%), potentially signaling a post-summer decline.


### Trends & Implications:

**I:** The fluctuations suggest potential seasonality, with content peaking mid-year and towards the end of the year.

**II:** The decline from August to November might indicate a slowdown before a holiday surge in December.


### Actionable Takeaways:

**I:** Investigate factors contributing to July and December spikes to leverage content strategy.

**II:** Explore the causes behind the August to November drop to mitigate future declines.

**III:** Consider aligning releases with peak months to maximise engagement.
