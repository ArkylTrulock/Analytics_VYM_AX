# Introduction

SQL queries? Check them out here: [sql_projects_folder](/SQL_Projects/)

# Background
TBC.

### The questions i wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the types of Netflix Media?
2. What are the Top 10 Directors?
3. What is the proportion Of Directors With Name Given And Name Not Given?
4. What are the Top 10 Directors excluding director Not Given?
5. What are the Top 10 Days? (LIMIT 10 was used for continuity. I know there are only 7 days!üòÇ).
6. What are the Top 10 Months?
7. What are the Top 10 Quarters?
8. What are the Top 10 Release Years?
9. What are the Top 10 Release Years And Quarters?
10. What are the Top 10 Ratings?
11. What are the Top 10 Countries?
12. What are the Top 10 Countries By Movie Count?
13. What are the Top 10 Countries By TV Show Count?


# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the Netflix Media Market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the Netflix Media.
Here's how I approached each question:


### 1. üî¢The Count, üíØPercentage, ‚è≥Previous Count, üìàüìâPercentage Change & üèÖCount Rank Of The Types Of Netflix Media[.sql](1_The_Count_And_Percentage_Of_Types_Of_Netflix_Media.sql)
To identify the Count, Percentage, Previous Count, Percentage Change & Count Rank the following functions were used: `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `LAG` and `DENSE_RANK`.

*This query highlights the types of Netflix Media.*

```sql
WITH movie_type AS (
    SELECT
        type,
        COUNT(type) AS count --(*) counts all rows in a table, including rows with NULL values.
    FROM 
        netflix_data
    --WHERE
        --type
        --AND
        --director
        --AND
        --country
    GROUP BY 
        type
),
count_formatted AS (
    SELECT
        type,
        count,
        TO_CHAR(count, 'FM999,999,999') AS formatted_count,
        ROUND((count * 100.0) / SUM(count) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
        --RANK() OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) AS count_rank
    FROM 
        movie_type
    --ORDER BY 
        --count ASC
        --count DESC
)
--SELECT
    --type,
    --count,
    --ROUND((count * 100.0) / SUM(count) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
    --RANK() OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) AS count_rank
SELECT
    type,
    count,
    ROUND((count * 100.0) / SUM(count) OVER (), 2) AS percentage,
    COALESCE(LAG(count) OVER (ORDER BY count DESC), 0) AS prev_count,  -- Replacing NULL with 0,
    CASE 
        WHEN LAG(count) OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) IS NOT NULL 
        THEN ROUND(((count - LAG(count) OVER (ORDER BY count DESC)) * 100.0) / LAG(count) OVER (ORDER BY count DESC), 2)
        ELSE 0
    END AS percentage_change,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) AS count_rank
FROM 
    count_formatted
ORDER BY
    --count ASC 
    count DESC;
```

# What I Learned

Throughout this adventure, I've turbocharged my SQL toolkit with some serious firepower:

- **üß© Complex Query Crafting:** Mastered the art of advanced SQL, merging tables like a pro and wielding `WITH` clauses for ninja-level temp table manoeuvres.
- **üìä Data Aggregation:** Got cozy with `GROUP BY` and turned aggregate functions like `COUNT()` and `AVG()` into my data-summarising sidekicks.
- **üí°Analystical Wizardry:** Leveled up my real-world puzzle solving skills, turning questions into actionable, insightful SQL queries.
