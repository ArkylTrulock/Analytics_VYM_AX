# Background
TBC.

### The questions i wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the types of Netflix Media?
2. What are the Top 10 Directors?
3. What is the proportion Of Directors With Name Given And Name Not Given?
4. What are the Top 10 Directors excluding director Not Given?
5. What are the Top 10 Days? (LIMIT 10 was used for continuity. I know there are only 7 days!üòÇ).
6. What are the Top 10 Months?
7. What are the Top 10 Quarters?
8. What are the Top 10 Release Years?
9. What are the Top 10 Release Years And Quarters?
10. What are the Top 10 Ratings?
11. What are the Top 10 Countries?
12. What are the Top 10 Countries By Movie Count?
13. What are the Top 10 Countries By TV Show Count?


# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the Netflix Media Market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the Netflix Media.
Here's how I approached each question:


### 1. üî¢The Count, üíØPercentage, ‚è≥Previous Count, üìàüìâPercentage Change & üèÖCount Rank Of The Types Of Netflix Media[.sql](1_The_Count_And_Percentage_Of_Types_Of_Netflix_Media.sql)
To identify the Count, Percentage, Previous Count, Percentage Change & Count Rank the following functions were used: `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `LAG` and `DENSE_RANK`.

*This query highlights the types of Netflix Media.*

```sql
WITH movie_type AS (
    SELECT
        type,
        COUNT(type) AS count --(*) counts all rows in a table, including rows with NULL values.
    FROM 
        netflix_data
    --WHERE
        --type
        --AND
        --director
        --AND
        --country
    GROUP BY 
        type
),
count_formatted AS (
    SELECT
        type,
        count,
        TO_CHAR(count, 'FM999,999,999') AS formatted_count,
        ROUND((count * 100.0) / SUM(count) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
        --RANK() OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) AS count_rank
    FROM 
        movie_type
    --ORDER BY 
        --count ASC
        --count DESC
)
--SELECT
    --type,
    --count,
    --ROUND((count * 100.0) / SUM(count) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
    --RANK() OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) AS count_rank
SELECT
    type,
    count,
    ROUND((count * 100.0) / SUM(count) OVER (), 2) AS percentage,
    COALESCE(LAG(count) OVER (ORDER BY count DESC), 0) AS prev_count,  -- Replacing NULL with 0,
    CASE 
        WHEN LAG(count) OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) IS NOT NULL 
        THEN ROUND(((count - LAG(count) OVER (ORDER BY count DESC)) * 100.0) / LAG(count) OVER (ORDER BY count DESC), 2)
        ELSE 0
    END AS percentage_change,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) AS count_rank
FROM 
    count_formatted
ORDER BY
    --count ASC 
    count DESC;
```

### General Overview:


### Key Insights & Interpretations:

**I:** Movies dominate the Netflix library, making up nearly 70% of the content.

**II:** TV Shows have seen a significant decline of 56.51% compared to the previous count.


### Trends & Implications:

**I** The sharp drop in TV Shows suggests a shift in content strategy, possibly favoring movies over series.

**II** Netflix may be focusing more on feature films, potentially due to audience preferences or production costs.


### Actionable Takeaways:

**I** Further analysis is needed to understand whether this trend aligns with viewership demand.

**II** Content strategy adjustments may be required to balance TV Show offerings if audience engagement remains high.


### 2. üî¢The Count, üíØPercentage, ‚è≥Previous Count, üìàüìâPercentage Change & üèÖCount Rank Of The Top 10 Directors[.sql](2_Top_10_Directors.sql)

```

### Dataframe
![Top 10 Directors - Table](Assets/SQL_2_Top_10_Directors_By_Count_And_Percentage.png)
*Generated using pandas library*

### General Overview:


### Key Insights & Interpretations:

**I** A staggering 94.90% of media entries have no director information, indicating incomplete metadata.

**II** The most credited director, Rajiv Chilaka, has seen a sharp 99.23% decline in count compared to the previous dataset.


### Trends & Implications:

**I** The lack of director attribution may affect content discovery, credibility, and analytics on directorial influence.

**II:** The decline in counts for most directors suggests possible content removals or shifts in production focus.


### Actionable Takeaways:

**I** Improving metadata completeness should be a priority to enhance data accuracy and insights.

**II** Further analysis is needed to determine if director-related trends impact audience engagement.

**II** The sharp drop after Friday implies a strategic pause in releases over the weekend.


### Actionable Takeaways:

**I** Netflix could explore increasing weekend releases to balance engagement throughout the week.

**II** Further analysis could determine if content released on specific days performs better in viewership.

# What I Learned

Throughout this adventure, I've turbocharged my SQL toolkit with some serious firepower:

- **üß© Complex Query Crafting:** Mastered the art of advanced SQL, merging tables like a pro and wielding `WITH` clauses for ninja-level temp table manoeuvres.
- **üìä Data Aggregation:** Got cozy with `GROUP BY` and turned aggregate functions like `COUNT()` and `AVG()` into my data-summarising sidekicks.
- **üí°Analystical Wizardry:** Leveled up my real-world puzzle solving skills, turning questions into actionable, insightful SQL queries.
