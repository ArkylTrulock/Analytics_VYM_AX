SQL queries? Check them out here: [sql_projects_folder](/SQL_Projects/PostgreSQL/Job_Data_Analysis/)

# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions i wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. Wat are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to nquery the bdatabase and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached eaxch question:


### 1. ðŸ’°Top 10 Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs In 2023[.sql](1_top_paying_jobs.sql)
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by `average yearly salary` , `job health insurance` and `job_location`, focusing on `remote jobs`. 

*This query highlights the high paying jobs in the field.*

```sql

      jpf.job_title_short,
      jpf.job_location,
      jpf.job_schedule_type,
      jpf.job_health_insurance,
      jpf.salary_year_avg,
      TO_CHAR(ROUND(jpf.salary_year_avg, 0),'FM999,999,999') AS formatted_salary,
      RANK() OVER (ORDER BY jpf.salary_year_avg DESC) AS salary_rank,
      CASE
          WHEN jpf.job_location = 'Anywhere' THEN 'Remote'

### General Overview
This table presents the Top 25 Most Demanded Data Analyst Skills in 2023, ranking them by demand count, average yearly salary, and their relative positions in demand and salary rankings. The heatmap coloring helps visually differentiate the most in-demand and highest-paying skills.

### Key Insights & Interpretations

**Most Demanded Skills:**
SQL leads with 398 job postings, followed by Excel (256), Python (236), and Tableau (230), confirming their dominance in the data analytics field.
Power BI (110) and R (148) show strong demand, highlighting the importance of visualisation and statistical programming.

**Salary vs. Demand**
While SQL is the most in-demand skill, its salary rank is 62nd, meaning higher-paying skills exist despite lower demand.
Go (Â£115,320), Hadoop (Â£113,193), and Snowflake (Â£112,948) offer the highest salaries, indicating specialized tools can command premium wages.
Excel (256 job postings, Â£87,288) remains essential but has one of the lowest salary rankings (86th).
Word (Â£82,576) and SharePoint (Â£81,634) rank lowest in salary, reflecting their lesser value in analytics roles.

### Trends & Implications
SQL, Python, and Tableau remain fundamental in data analytics, ensuring strong job security.
Niche skills like Snowflake, Go, and Hadoop command higher salaries, indicating that cloud-based data solutions and big data expertise are lucrative.
Microsoft Office tools (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) still hold value but arenâ€™t high earners, suggesting that analysts should supplement these with technical skills.
Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS) and data engineering skills (Hadoop, SQL Server) are gaining traction, making them excellent options for career growth.

### Actionable Takeaways
If aiming for high demand, focus on SQL, Excel, Python, and Tableau.
If prioritizing salary growth, consider specializing in Hadoop, Snowflake, Go, or cloud platforms like AWS/Azure.
Develop a combination of high-demand and high-paying skills for the best career prospects in data analytics.

### General Overview:
The table lists the Top 25 highest-paying skills for Data Analysts in 2023, ranking them by average yearly salary, demand count, and count rank (popularity).

### Key Insights & Interpretations:
**Highest Paying Skill:** PySpark leads with an average salary of Â£208,172, followed by Bitbucket (Â£189,154).

Rare Yet Lucrative Skills: Couchbase, Watson, and DataRobot pay over Â£150K+ but have low demand, indicating niche expertise.

Popular but Mid-Tier Pay: Pandas (9 demand count, Â£151,821) and Databricks (10 demand count, Â£141,907) are highly in demand yet offer relatively lower pay.

**Big Data & Cloud Dominate:** PySpark, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, Databricks, GCP, and PostgreSQL highlight the importance of big data & cloud skills.
AI & ML in the Mix: Watson, Scikit-learn, and DataRobot indicate AI/ML skills command high salaries.

### Trends & Implications:
High-Paying Skills Aren't Always Popular: The highest salaries often belong to rare, specialized skills (PySpark, Bitbucket, Couchbase).

**Big Data & Cloud are Essential:** Companies highly value data engineering, distributed computing, and cloud platforms.

**Python Ecosystem Still Dominant:** Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn are staples for analysts but rank lower in salary.

**Full-Stack Data Skills Pay Well:** Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and PostgreSQL suggest a shift towards data infrastructure & engineering roles.

### Actionable Takeaways:

**Master Niche Technologies:** Specializing in PySpark, Bitbucket, or AI-driven platforms can unlock six-figure salaries.

**Go Beyond Python Basics:** Pair Pandas & Numpy with PySpark, Databricks, and cloud-based data processing to boost earning potential.

**Invest in Cloud & DevOps:** Kubernetes, Jenkins, GCP, and PostgreSQL show increasing relevance for data professionals.

**Stay Ahead with AI & ML:** Knowledge of Watson, Scikit-learn, and DataRobot could future-proof your career

### General Overview
This visualisation presents the top 25 optimal Skills for data analysts in 2023, ranked based on their demand count, average yearly salary, and overall ranking metrics. The table includes key skills such as Python, SQL, Hadoop, and AWS, displaying their demand in the job market alongside their earning potential. A heatmap-style color gradient is used to highlight variations, with darker green shades indicating higher salaries, while red and brown shades emphasize high demand but relatively lower salaries in comparison.

### Key Insights & Interpretations
From the visualisation, skills like Go, Confluence, and Hadoop rank highest in terms of salary, earning over Â£113,000 per year on average. However, the most in-demand skills, such as Python (236 demand count) and Tableau (230 demand count), do not rank as highly in salary, suggesting that while they are essential, their high supply keeps wages competitive. Interestingly, specialized skills like SAS (63 demand count) and SSIS (12 demand count) show moderate demand but relatively good salary rankings. This indicates that niche expertise can still yield strong compensation.

### Trends & Implications
The data suggests that while commonly used data analyst skills like Python, R, and SQL Server are widely required, emerging or less mainstream skills like Go and Confluence are commanding the highest salaries. This could indicate that companies are willing to pay more for expertise in newer or less common tools. Additionally, while some tools like Jira and Looker have decent demand and salary prospects, they may be complementary rather than primary analytical skills. This visualisation helps job seekers and professionals prioritize skill development based on a balance of demand and earning potential.
